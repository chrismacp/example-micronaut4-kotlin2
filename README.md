# example-micronaut4-kotlin2

A simple example of a service that uses Micronaut 4, Kotlin 2, Kotest, and Rest Assured.

As I'm testing things out it's not fully featured or architected aside from a basic controller/service/repo structure.

## Main Dependencies

Micronaut - 4.6.0

Kotlin - 2.2.21

RestAssured - 5.5.6

Problem+JSON (Zalando) - 0.27.1
